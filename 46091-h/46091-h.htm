<p Class="exit">[<i>Hobbles off,</i> R. 1. E.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> You are out early this morning, George.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> I was up before daylight. We got the horses saddled, and galloped down the shell road over the Piney Patch; then coasting the Bayou Lake, we crossed the long swamps, by Paul's Path, and so came home again.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> [<i>Laughing.</i>] You seem already familiar with the names of every spot on the estate.</p>

<p class="direct"><i>Enter</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Pete.</span><i>&mdash;Arranges breakfast, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><i>George.</i> Just one month ago I quitted Paris. I left that siren city as I would have left a beloved woman.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> No wonder! I dare say you left at least a dozen beloved women there, at the same time.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> I feel that I departed amid universal and sincere regret. I left my loves and my creditors equally inconsolable.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> George, you are incorrigible. Ah! you remind me so much of your uncle, the judge.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Bless his dear old handwriting, it's all I ever saw of him. For ten years his letters came every quarter-day, with a remittance and a word of advice in his formal cavalier style; and then a joke in the postscript, that upset the dignity of the foregoing. Aunt, when he died, two years ago, I read over those letters of his, and if I didn't cry like a baby&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> No, George; say you wept like a man. And so you really kept those foolish letters?</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Yes; I kept the letters, and squandered the money.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> [<i>Embracing him.</i>] Ah! why were you not my son&mdash;you are so like my dear husband.</p>

<p Class="direct"><i>Enter</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Salem Scudder,</span> R.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Ain't he! Yes&mdash;when I saw him and Miss Zoe galloping through the green sugar crop, and doing ten dollars' worth of damage at every stride, says I, how like his old uncle he do make the dirt fly.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> O, aunt! what a bright, gay creature she is!</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> What, Zoe! Guess that you didn't leave anything female in Europe that can lift an eyelash beside that gal. When she goes along, she just leaves a streak of love behind her. It's a good drink to see her come into the cotton fields&mdash;the niggers get fresh on the sight of her. If she ain't worth her weight in sunshine you may take one of my fingers off, and choose which you like.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> She need not keep us waiting breakfast, though. Pete, tell Miss Zoe that we are waiting.</p>

<p><i>Pete.</i> Yes, missus. Why, Minnie, why don't you run when you hear, you lazy crittur? [<i>Minnie runs off.</i>] Dat's de laziest nigger on dis yere property. [<i>Sits down.</i>] Don't do nuffin.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> My dear George, you are left in your uncle's will heir to
this estate.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Subject to your life interest and an annuity to Zoe, is it
not so?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> I fear that the property is so involved that the strictest
economy will scarcely recover it. My dear husband never kept any
accounts, and we scarcely know in what condition the estate really
is.</p>

<p><i>Scad.</i> Yes, we do, ma'am; it's in a darned bad condition. Ten years
ago the judge took as overseer a bit of Connecticut hardware called
M'Closky. The judge didn't understand accounts&mdash;the overseer did. For
a year or two all went fine. The judge drew money like Bourbon
whiskey from a barrel, and never turned off the tap. But out it flew,
free for everybody or anybody to beg, borrow, or steal. So it went,
till one day the judge found the tap wouldn't run. He looked in to
see what stopped it, and pulled out a big mortgage. "Sign that," says
the overseer; "it's only a formality." "All right," says the judge,
and away went a thousand acres; so at the end of eight years, Jacob
M'Closky, Esquire, finds himself proprietor of the richest half of
Terrebonne&mdash;</p>

<p><i>George.</i> But the other half is free.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> No, it ain't; because, just then, what does the judge do, but
hire another overseer&mdash;a Yankee&mdash;a Yankee named Salem Scudder.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> O, no, it was&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Hold on, now! I'm going to straighten this account clear out.
What was this here Scudder? Well, he lived in New York by sittin'
with his heels up in front of French's Hotel, and inventin'&mdash;</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Inventing what?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Improvements&mdash;anything, from a stay-lace to a fire-engine.
Well, he cut that for the photographing line. He and his apparatus
arrived here, took the judge's likeness and his fancy, who made him
overseer right off. Well, sir, what does this Scudder do but
introduces his inventions and improvements on this estate. His new
cotton gins broke down, the steam sugar-mills burst up, until he
finished off with his folly what Mr. M'Closky with his knavery began.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> O, Salem! how can you say so? Haven't you worked like a horse?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> No, ma'am, I worked like an ass&mdash;an honest one, and that's all.
Now, Mr. George, between the two overseers, you and that good old
lady have come to the ground; that is the state of things, just as
near as I can fix it. [<i>Zoe sings without,</i> L.]</p>

<p><i>George.</i> 'Tis Zoe.</p>

<p><I>Scud.</i> O, I have not spoiled that anyhow. I can't introduce any darned
improvement there. Ain't that a cure for old age; it kinder lifts the
heart up, don't it?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Poor child! what will become of her when I am gone? If you
haven't spoiled her, I fear I have. She has had the education of a
lady.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> I have remarked that she is treated by the neighbors with a
kind of familiar condescension that annoyed me.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Don't you know that she is the natural daughter of the judge,
your uncle, and that old lady thar just adored anything her husband
cared for; and this girl, that another woman would a hated, she
loves as if she'd been her own child.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Aunt, I am prouder and happier to be your nephew and heir to
the ruins of Terrebonne, than I would have been to have had half
Louisiana without you.</p>

<P class="direct"><i>Enter</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Zoe,</span><i> from house,</i> L.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Am I late? Ah! Mr. Scudder, good morning.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Thank'ye. I'm from fair to middlin', like a bamboo cane, much
the same all the year round.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> No; like a sugar cane; so dry outside, one would never think
there was so much sweetness within.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Look here; I can't stand that gal! if I stop here, I shall hug
her right off. [<i>Sees</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Pete,</span><i> who has set his pail down</i> L. C. <i>up stage,

just in time for breakfast. [<i>Sits,</i> R.]</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> O, none for me; I never eat. [<i>Sits,</i> R. C.]</p>

<p><i>George.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] They do not notice Zoe.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] You don't see Zoe,
Mr. Sunnyside.</p>

<p><i>Sunny.</i> Ah! Zoe, girl; are you there?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> Take my shawl, Zoe. [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">Zoe</span><i> helps her.</i>] What a good creature
she is.</p>

<p><i>Sunny.</i> I dare say, now, that in Europe you have never met any lady
more beautiful in person, or more polished in manners, than that girl.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> You are right, sir; though I shrank from expressing that
opinion in her presence, so bluntly.</p>

<p><i>Sunny.</i> Why so?</p>

<p><i>George.</i> It may be considered offensive.</p>

<p><i>Sunny.</i> [<i>Astonished.</i>] What? I say, Zoe, do you hear that?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> Mr. Peyton is joking.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> [L. C.] My nephew is not acquainted with our customs in
Louisiana, but he will soon understand.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Never, aunt! I shall never understand how to wound the
feelings of any lady; and, if that is the custom here, I shall
never acquire it.</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> Zoe, my dear, what does he mean?</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> I don't know.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Excuse me, I'll light a cigar. [<i>Goes up.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> [<i>Aside to Zoe.</i>] Isn't he sweet! O, dear Zoe, is he in love
with anybody?</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> How can I tell?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> Ask him, I want to know; don't say I told you to inquire, but
find out. Minnie, fan me, it is so nice&mdash;and his clothes are French,
ain't they?</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> I think so; shall I ask him that too?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> No, dear. I wish he would make love to me. When he speaks to
one he does it so easy, so gentle; it isn't bar-room style; love
lined with drinks, sighs tinged with tobacco&mdash;and they say all the
women in Paris were in love with him, which I feel <i><b>I</b></i> shall be;
stop fanning me; what nice boots he wears.</p>

<p><i>Sunny.</i> [<i>To</i><span style="font-variant:small-caps"> Mrs. Peyton.</span>] Yes, ma'am, I hold a mortgage over
Terrebonne; mine's a ninth, and pretty near covers all the property,
except the slaves. I believe Mr. M'Closky has a bill of sale on them.
O, here he is.</p>

<p Class="direct"><i>Enter</i><span style="font-variant:small-caps"> M'Closky,</span> R.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E.</p>

<p><i>Sunny.</i> Good morning, Mr. M'Closky.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Good morning, Mr. Sunnyside; Miss Dora, your servant.</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> [<i>Seated,</i> R. C.] Fan me, Minnie.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] I don't like that man.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> [<i>Aside,</i> C.] Insolent as usual.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] You begged me to
call this morning. I hope I'm not intruding.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> My nephew, Mr. Peyton.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> O, how d'ye do, sir? [<i>Offers hand, </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">George</span><i> bows coldly,</i>
R. C.] [<i>aside.</i>] A puppy, if he brings any of his European airs here
we'll fix him.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] Zoe, tell Pete to give my mare a feed, will
ye?

<p><i>George.</i> [<i>Angrily.</i>] Sir.

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Hillo! did I tread on ye?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> What is the matter with George?</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> [<i>Takes fan from </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Minnie.</span>] Go, Minnie, tell Pete; run!</p>
<p class="exit">[<i>Exit </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Minnie,</span> R.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Grace, attend to Mr. M'Closky.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> A julep, gal, that's my breakfast, and a bit of cheese,</p>

<p><i>George.</i> [<i>Aside to </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Mrs. Peyton.</span>] How can you ask that vulgar ruffian
to your table?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Hospitality in Europe is a courtesy; here, it is an
obligation. We tender food to a stranger, not because he is a
gentleman, but because he is hungry.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Aunt, I will take my rifle down to the Atchafalaya. Paul has
promised me a bear and a deer or two. I see my little Nimrod yonder,
with his Indian companion. Excuse me ladies. Ho! Paul! [<i>Enters house.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i> [<i>Outside.</i>] I'ss, Mas'r George.</p>

<p Class="direct"><i>Enter </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Paul,</span> R.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E., <i>with</i> <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Indian,</span><i> who goes up.</i></p>

<p><i>Sunny.</i> It's a shame to allow that young cub to run over the Swamps
and woods, hunting and fishing his life away instead of hoeing cane.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> The child was a favorite of the judge, who encouraged his
gambols. I couldn't bear to see him put to work.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> [<i>Returning with rifle.</i>] Come, Paul, are you ready?</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i> I'ss, Mas'r George. O, golly! ain't that a pooty gun.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> See here, you imps; if I catch you, and your red skin
yonder, gunning in my swamps, I'll give you rats, mind; them
vagabonds, when the game's about, shoot my pigs.</p>

<p class="direct">[<i>Exit </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">George</span><i> into house.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i> You gib me rattan, Mas'r Clostry, but I guess you take a berry
long stick to Wahnotee; ugh, he make bacon of you.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Make bacon of me, you young whelp. Do you mean that I'm a
pig? Hold on a bit. [<i>Seizes whip, and holds </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Paul.</span>]</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> O, sir! don't, pray, don't.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> [<i>Slowly lowering his whip,</i>] Darn you, red skin, I'll pay
you off some day, both of ye. [<i>Returns to table and drinks.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Sunny.</i> That Indian is a nuisance. Why don't he return to his nation
out West?</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> He's too fond of thieving and whiskey.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> No; Wahnotee is a gentle, honest creature, and remains here
because he loves that boy with the tenderness of a woman. When Paul
was taken down with the swamp fever the Indian sat outside the hut,
and neither ate, slept, or spoke for five days, till the child could
recognize and call him to his bedside. He who can love so well is
honest&mdash;don't speak ill of poor Wahnotee.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Wahnotee, will you go back to your people?</p>

<p><i>Wahnotee.</i> Sleugh.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i> He don't understand; he speaks a mash-up of Indian and Mexican.
Wahnotee Patira na sepau assa wigiran.</p>

<p><i>Wahnotee.</i> Weal Omenee.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i> Says he'll go if I'll go with him. He calls me Omenee, the
Pigeon, and Miss Zoe is Ninemoosha, the Sweetheart.</p>

<p><i>Wahnotee.</i> [<i>Pointing to Zoe.</i>] Ninemoosha.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> No, Wahnotee, we can't spare Paul.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i> If Omenee remain, Wahnotee will die in Terrebonne. [<i>During the
dialogue </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Wahnotee</span><i> has taken </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">George's</span><i> gun.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> Zoe, he's going; I want him to stay and make love to me that's
what I came for to-day.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> George, I can't spare Paul for an hour or two; he must run
over to the landing; the steamer from New Orleans passed up the river
last night, and if there's a mail they have thrown it ashore.</p>

<p><i>Sunny.</i> I saw the mail-bags lying in the shed this morning.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> I expect an important letter from Liverpool; away with you,
Paul; bring the mail-bags here.</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i> I'm 'most afraid to take Wahnotee to the shed, there's
rum there.</p>

<p><i>Wahnotee.</i> Rum!</p>

<p><i>Paul.</i> Come, then, but if I catch you drinkin', O, laws a mussey,
you'll get snakes! I'll gib it you! now mind.</p>

<p class="exit">[<i>Exit with </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Indian,</span>

<p><i>George.</i> Come, Miss Dora, let me offer you my arm.</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> Mr. George, I am afraid, if all we hear is true, you have led
a dreadful life in Europe.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> That's a challenge to begin a description of my feminine
adventures.</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> You have been in love, then?</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Two hundred and forty-nine times! Let me relate you the
worst cases.</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> No! no!</p>

<p><i>George.</i> I'll put the naughty parts in French.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Now, ma'am, I'd like a little business, if agreeable. I
bring you news; your banker, old Lafouche, of New Orleans, is dead;
the executors are winding up his affairs, and have foreclosed on all
overdue mortgages, so Terrebonne is for sale. Here's the Picayune
[<i>producing paper</i>] with the advertisement.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Terrebonne for sale!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Terrebonne for sale, and you, sir, will doubtless become
its purchaser.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Well, ma'am, I spose there's no law agin my bidding for it.
The more bidders, the better for you. You'll take care, I guess, it
don't go too cheap.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> O, sir, I don't value the place for its price, but for the
many happy days I've spent here; that landscape, flat and
uninteresting though it may be, is full of charm for me; those poor
people, born around me, growing up about my heart, have bounded my
view of life; and now to lose that homely scene, lose their black,
ungainly faces; O, sir, perhaps you should be as old as I am, to feel
as I do, when my past life is torn away from me.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> I'd be darned glad if somebody would tear my past life away
from me. Sorry I can't help you, but the fact is, you're in such an
all-fired mess that you couldn't be pulled out without a derrick.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Yes, there is a hope left yet, and I cling to it. The house
of Mason Brothers, of Liverpool, failed some twenty years ago in my
husband's debt.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> They owed him over fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> I cannot find the entry in my husband's accounts; but you,
Mr. M'Closky, can doubtless detect it. Zoe, bring here the judge's
old desk; it is in the library.</p>

<p class="exit">[<i>Exit </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Zoe</span><i> to house.</i></p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> You don't expect to recover any of this old debt, do you?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Yes; the firm has recovered itself, and I received a notice
two months ago that some settlement might be anticipated.</p>

<p><i>Sunny.</i> Why, with principal and interest this debt has been more than
doubled in twenty years.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> But it may be years yet before it will be paid off, if ever.</p>

<p><i>Sunny.</i> If there's a chance of it, there's not a planter round here
who wouldn't lend you the whole cash, to keep your name and blood
amongst us. Come, cheer up, old friend.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Ah! Sunnyside, how good you are; so like my poor Peyton.</p>

<p class="exit">[<i>Exit </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Mrs. Peyton</span><i> and </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Sunnyside</span><i> to house.</i></p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Curse their old families&mdash;they cut me&mdash;a bilious, conceited,
thin lot of dried up aristocracy. I hate 'em. Just because my
grandfather wasn't some broken-down Virginia transplant, or a stingy
old Creole, I ain't fit to sit down with the same meat with them. It
makes my blood so hot I feel my heart hiss. I'll sweep these Peytons
from this section of the country. Their presence keeps alive the
reproach against me that I ruined them; yet, if this money should
come. Bah! There's no chance of it. Then, if they go, they'll take
Zoe&mdash;she'll follow them. Darn that girl; she makes me quiver when I
think of her; she's took me for all I'm worth.</p>

<p class="direct"><i>Enter </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Zoe</span><i> from house, </i>L.,<i> with the desk.</i></p>

<p>O, here, do you know what annuity the old judge left you is worth
to-day? Not a picayune.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> It's surely worth the love that dictated it; here are the
papers and accounts. [<i>Putting it on the table,</i> R. C.]</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Stop, Zoe; come here! How would you like to rule the house
of the richest planter on Atchafalaya&mdash;eh? or say the word, and I'll
buy this old barrack, and you shall be mistress of Terrebonne.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> O, sir, do not speak so to me!</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Why not! look here, these Peytons are bust; cut 'em; I am
rich, jine me; I'll set you up grand, and we'll give these first
families here our dust, until you'll see their white skins shrivel
up with hate and rage; what d'ye say?</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Let me pass! O, pray, let me go!</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> What, you won't, won't ye? If young George Peyton was to
make you the same offer, you'd jump at it, pretty darned quick, I
guess. Come, Zoe, don't be a fool; I'd marry you if I could, but you
know I can't; so just say what you want. Here then, I'll put back
these Peytons in Terrebonne, and they shall know you done it; yes,
they'll have you to thank for saving them from ruin.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Do you think they would live here on such terms?</p>

<p><i>M'Closky,</i> Why not? We'll hire out our slaves, and live on their
wages.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> But I'm not a slave.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> No; if you were I'd buy you, if you cost all I'm worth.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Let me pass!</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Stop.</p>

<p class="direct"><i>Enter </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Scudder,</span> R.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Eh?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Let her pass! [<i>Takes out his knife.</i>]</p>

<p class="exit">[<i>Exit </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Zoe</span><i> to house.</i></p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Is that you, Mr. Overseer? [<i>Examines paper.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Yes, I'm here, somewhere, interferin'.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> [<i>Sitting,</i> R. C.] A pretty mess you've got this estate in&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Yes&mdash;me and Co.&mdash;we done it; but, as you were senior partner in
the concern, I reckon you got the big lick.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> What d'ye mean.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Let me proceed by illustration. [<i>Sits,</i> R.] Look thar! [<i>Points
with knife off,</i> R.] D'ye see that tree?&mdash;it's called a live oak, and
is a native here; beside it grows a creeper; year after year that
creeper twines its long arms round and round the tree&mdash;sucking the
earth dry all about its roots&mdash;living on its life&mdash;overrunning its
branches, until at last the live oak withers and dies out. Do you
know what the niggers round here call that sight? they call it the
Yankee hugging the Creole. [<i>Sits.</i>]</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Mr. Scudder, I've listened to a great many of your
insinuations, and now I'd like to come to an understanding what they
mean. If you want a quarrel&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Scudder.</i> No, I'm the skurriest crittur at a fight you ever see; my
legs have been too well brought up to stand and see my body abused;
I take good care of myself, I can tell you.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Because I heard that you had traduced my character.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Traduced! Whoever said so lied. I always said you were the
darndest thief that ever escaped a white jail to misrepresent the
North to the South.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> [<i>Raises hand to back of his neck.</i>] What!</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Take your hand down&mdash;take it down. [<span style="font-variant:small-caps">M'Closky</span><i> lowers his hand.</i>]
Whenever I gets into company like yours, I always start with the
advantage on my side.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> What d'ye mean?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> I mean that before you could draw that bowie-knife, you wear
down your back, I'd cut you into shingles. Keep quiet, and let's talk
sense. You wanted to come to an understanding, and I'm coming thar as
quick as I can. Now, Jacob M'Closky, you despise me because you think
I'm a fool; I despise you because I know you to be a knave. Between
us we've ruined these Peytons; you fired the judge, and I finished
off the widow. Now, I feel bad about my share in the business. I'd
give half the balance of my life to wipe out my part of the work.
Many a night I've laid awake and thought how to pull them through,
till I've cried like a child over the sum I couldn't do; and you know
how darned hard 'tis to make a Yankee cry.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Well, what's that to me?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Hold on, Jacob, I'm coming to that&mdash;I tell ye, I'm such a
fool&mdash;I can't bear the feeling, it keeps at me like a skin
complaint, and if this family is sold up&mdash;</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> What then?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> [<i>Rising.</i>] I'd cut my throat&mdash;or yours&mdash;yours I'd prefer.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Would you now? why don't you do it?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> 'Cos I's skeered to try! I never killed a man in my life&mdash;and
civilization is so strong in me I guess I couldn't do it&mdash;I'd like
to, though!</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> And all for the sake of that old woman and that young
puppy&mdash;eh? No other cause to hate&mdash;to envy me&mdash;to be jealous of
me&mdash;eh?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Jealous! what for?</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Ask the color in your face; d'ye think I can't read you,
like a book? With your New England hypocrisy, you would persuade
yourself it was this family alone you cared for; it ain't&mdash;you know
it ain't&mdash;'tis the "Octoroon;" and you love her as I do; and you hate
me because I'm your rival&mdash;that's where the tears come from, Salem
Scudder, if you ever shed any&mdash;that's where the shoe pinches.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Wal, I do like the gal; she's a&mdash;</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> She's in love with young Peyton; it made me curse, whar it
made you cry, as it does now; I see the tears on your cheeks now.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Look at 'em, Jacob, for they are honest water from the well of
truth. I ain't ashamed of it&mdash;I do love the gal; but I ain't jealous
of you, because I believe the only sincere feeling about you is your
love for Zoe, and it does your heart good to have her image thar; but
I believe you put it thar to spile. By fair means I don't think you
can get her, and don't you try foul with her, 'cause if you do,
Jacob, civilization be darned. I'm on you like a painter, and when
I'm drawed out I'm pizin.</p>

<p class="exit">[<i>Exit </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Scudder</span><i> to house,</i> L.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Fair or foul, I'll have her&mdash;take that home with you!
[<i>Opens desk.</i>] What's here&mdash;judgments? yes, plenty of 'em; bill of
costs; account with Citizens' Bank&mdash;what's this? "Judgment, 40,000,
'Thibodeaux against Peyton,'"&mdash;surely, that is the judgment under
which this estate is now advertised for sale&mdash;[<i>takes up paper and

this is worth taking to&mdash;in this desk the judge used to keep one
paper I want&mdash;this should be it. [<i>Reads.</i>] "The free papers of my
daughter, Zoe, registered February 4th, 1841." Why, judge, wasn't you
lawyer enough to know that while a judgment stood against you it was
a lien on your slaves? Zoe is your child by a quadroon slave, and you
didn't free her; blood! if this is so, she's mine! this old Liverpool
debt&mdash;that may cross me&mdash;if it only arrive too late&mdash;if it don't come
by this mail&mdash;Hold on! this letter the old lady expects&mdash;that's it;
let me only head off that letter, and Terrebonne will be sold before
they can recover it. That boy and the Indian have gone down to the
landing for the post-bags; they'll idle on the way as usual; my mare
will take me across the swamp, and before they can reach the shed, I'll
have purified them bags&mdash;ne'er a letter shall show this mail. Ha,
ha!&mdash;[<i>Calls.</i>] Pete, you old turkey-buzzard, saddle my mare. Then,
if I sink every dollar I'm worth in her purchase, I'll own that
Octoroon. [<i>Stands with his hand extended towards the house,

<p><i>George.</i> Has my love been divined?</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> It has been more than suspected.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Zoe, listen to me, then. I shall see this estate pass from
me without a sigh, for it possesses no charm for me; the wealth I
covet is the love of those around me&mdash;eyes that are rich in fond
looks, lips that breathe endearing words; the only estate I value is
the heart of one true woman, and the slaves I'd have are her
thoughts.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> George, George, your words take away my breath!</p>

<p><i>George.</i> The world, Zoe, the free struggle of minds and hands, if
before me; the education bestowed on me by my dear uncle is a noble
heritage which no sheriff can seize; with that I can build up a
fortune, spread a roof over the heads I love, and place before them
the food I have earned; I will work&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Work! I thought none but colored people worked.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Work, Zoe, is the salt that gives savor to life.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Dora said you were slow; if she could hear you now&mdash;</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Zoe, you are young; your mirror must have told you that you
are beautiful. Is your heart free?</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Free? of course it is!</p>

<p><i>George.</i> We have known each other but a few days, but to me those days
have been worth all the rest of my life. Zoe, you have suspected the
feeling that now commands an utterance&mdash;you have seen that I love you.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Me! you love me?</p>

<p><i>George.</i> As my wife,&mdash;the sharer of my hopes, my ambitions, and my
sorrows; under the shelter of your love I could watch the storms of
fortune pass unheeded by.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> My love! My love? George, you know not what you say. I the
sharer of your sorrows&mdash;your wife. Do you know what I am?</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Your birth&mdash;I know it. Has not my dear aunt forgotten it&mdash;she
who had the most right to remember it? You are illegitimate, but love
knows no prejudice.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Alas! he does not know, he does not know! and will
despise me, spurn me, loathe me, when he learns who, what, he has so
loved.&mdash;[<i>Aloud.</i>] George, O, forgive me! Yes, I love you&mdash;I did not
know it until your words showed me what has been in my heart; each of
them awoke a new sense, and now I know how unhappy&mdash;how very unhappy
I am.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Zoe, what have I said to wound you?</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Nothing; but you must learn what I thought you already knew.
George, you cannot marry me; the laws forbid it!</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Forbid it?</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> There is a gulf between us, as wide as your love, as deep as my
despair; but, O, tell me, say you will pity me! that you will not
throw me from you like a poisoned thing!</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Zoe, explain yourself&mdash;your language fills me with shapeless
fears.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> And what shall I say? I&mdash;my mother was&mdash;no, no&mdash;not her! Why
should I refer the blame to her? George, do you see that hand you
hold? look at these fingers; do you see the nails are of a bluish
tinge?</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Yes, near the quick there is a faint blue mark.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Look in my eyes; is not the same color in the white?</p>

<p><i>George.</i> It is their beauty.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Could you see the roots of my hair you would see the same dark,
fatal mark. Do you know what that is?</p>

<p><i>George.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> That is the ineffaceable curse of Cain. Of the blood that feeds
my heart, one drop in eight is black&mdash;bright red as the rest may be,
that one drop poisons all the flood; those seven bright drops give
me love like yours&mdash;hope like yours&mdash;ambition like yours&mdash;Life
hung with passions like dew-drops on the morning flowers; but the
one black drop gives me despair, for I'm an unclean thing&mdash;forbidden
by the laws&mdash;I'm an Octoroon!</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Zoe, I love you none the less; this knowledge brings no
revolt to my heart, and I can overcome the obstacle.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> But I cannot.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> We can leave this country, and go far away where none
can know.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> And our mother, she who from infancy treated me with such
fondness, she who, as you said, had most reason to spurn me, can
she forget what I am? Will she gladly see you wedded to the child of
her husband's slave? No! she would revolt from it, as all but you
would; and if I consented to hear the cries of my heart, if I did not
crush out my infant love, what would she say to the poor girl on whom
she had bestowed so much? No, no!</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Zoe, must we immolate our lives on her prejudice?</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Yes, for I'd rather be black than ungrateful! Ah, George, our
race has at least one virtue&mdash;it knows how to suffer!</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Each word you utter makes my love sink deeper into my heart.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> And I remained here to induce you to offer that heart to Dora!</p>

<p><i>George.</i> If you bid me do so I will obey you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> No, no! if you cannot be mine, O, let me not blush when I think
of you.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> [C.] My dear aunt, why do you not move from this painful
scene? Go with Dora to Sunnyside.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> [R.] No, George; your uncle said to me with his dying breath,
"Nellie, never leave Terrebonne," and I never will leave it, till the
law compels me.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> [L.] Mr. George, I'm going to say somethin' that has been
chokin' me for some time. I know you'll excuse it. Thar's Miss
Dora&mdash;that girl's in love with you; yes, sir, her eyes are startin'
out of her head with it; now her fortune would redeem a good part of
this estate.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Why, George, I never suspected this!</p>

<p><i>George.</i> I did, aunt, I confess, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> And you hesitated from motives of delicacy?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> No, ma'am; here's the plan of it. Mr. George is in love with
Zoe.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Scudder!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> George!</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Hold on now! things have got so jammed in on top of us, we
ain't got time to put kid gloves on to handle them. He loves Zoe, and
has found out that she loves him. [<i>Sighing.</i>] Well, that's all right;
but as he can't marry her, and as Miss Dora would jump at him&mdash;

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> Why didn't you mention this before?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Why, because I love Zoe, too, and I couldn't take that young
feller from her; and she's jist living on the sight of him, as I saw
her do; and they so happy in spite of this yer misery around them,
and they reproachin' themselves with not feeling as they ought. I've
seen it, I tell you; and darn it, ma'am, can't you see that's what's
been a hollowing me out so&mdash;I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> O, George,&mdash;my son, let me call you,&mdash;I do not speak for my
own sake, nor for the loss of the estate, but for the poor people
here; they will be sold, divided, and taken away&mdash;they have been born
here. Heaven has denied me children; so all the strings of my heart
have grown around and amongst them, like the fibres and roots of an
old tree in its native earth. O, let all go, but save them! With them
around us, if we have not wealth, we shall at least have the home
that they alone can make&mdash;</p>

<p><i>George.</i> My dear mother&mdash;Mr. Scudder&mdash;you teach me what I ought to do;
if Miss Sunnyside will accept me as I am, Terrebonne shall be saved;
I will sell myself, but the slaves shall be protected.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P. <b>Sell</b></i> yourself, George! Is not Dora worth any man's&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Don't say that, ma'am; don't say that to a man that loves
another gal. He's going to do an heroic act; don't spile it.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. P.</i> But Zoe is only an Octoroon.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> She's won this race agin the white, anyhow; it's too late now
to start her pedigree.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> [<i>Seeing </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Dora.</span>] Come, Mrs. Peyton, take my arm. Hush! here's the

<p><i>George.</i> Miss Sunnyside, permit me a word; a feeling of delicacy has

<p><i>Dora.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] O, dear, has he suddenly come to his senses?</p>

<p class="direct"><i>Enter </i><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Zoe,</span> L.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;E.,<i> she stops at back.</i></p>

<p><i>George.</i> In a word, I have seen and admired you!</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] He has a strange way of showing it. European, I
suppose.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> If you would pardon the abruptness of the question, I would
ask you, Do you think the sincere devotion of my life to make yours
happy would succeed?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] Well, he has the oddest way of making love.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> You are silent?</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> Mr. Peyton, I presume you have hesitated to make this avowal
because you feared, in the present condition of affairs here, your
object might be misconstrued, and that your attention was rather to
my fortune than myself. [<i>A pause.</i>] Why don't he speak?&mdash;I mean, you
feared I might not give you credit for sincere and pure feelings.
Well, you wrong me. I don't think you capable of anything else than&mdash;</p>

<p><i>George.</i> No, I hesitated because an attachment I had formed before I
had the pleasure of seeing you had not altogether died out.</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> [<i>Smiling.</i>] Some of those sirens of Paris, I presume, [<i>Pause.</i>]
I shall endeavor not to be jealous of the past; perhaps I have no
right to be. [<i>Pause.</i>] But now that vagrant love is&mdash;eh? faded&mdash;is it
not? Why don't you speak, sir?</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Because, Miss Sunnyside, I have not learned to lie.</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> Good gracious&mdash;who wants you to?</p>

<p><i>George.</i> I do, but I can't do it. No, the love I speak of is not such
as you suppose,&mdash;it is a passion that has grown up here since I
arrived; but it is a hopeless, mad, wild feeling, that must perish.</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> Here! since you arrived! Impossible; you have seen no one; whom
can you mean?</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</I> [<i>Advancing,</i> C.] Me.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> [L.] Zoe!</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> [R.] You!</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Forgive him, Dora; for he knew no better until I told him. Dora,
you are right. He is incapable of any but sincere and pure
feelings&mdash;so are you. He loves me&mdash;what of that? You know you can't
be jealous of a poor creature like me. If he caught the fever, were
stung by a snake, or possessed of any other poisonous or unclean
thing, you could pity, tend, love him through it, and for your gentle
care he would love you in return. Well, is he not thus afflicted now?
I am his love&mdash;he loves an Octoroon.</p>

<p><I>George.</i> O, Zoe, you break my heart!</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> At college they said I was a fool&mdash;I must be. At New Orleans,
they said, "She's pretty, very pretty, but no brains." I'm afraid they
must be right; I can't understand a word of all this.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Dear Dora, try to understand it with your heart. You love
George; you love him dearly; I know it: and you deserve to be loved
by him. He will love you&mdash;he must. His love for me will pass away&mdash;it
shall. You heard him say it was hopeless. O, forgive him and me!</p>

<p><i>Dora.</i> [<i>Weeping.</i>] O, why did he speak to me at all then? You've made
me cry, then, and I hate you both!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pey.</i> [<i>Takes them.</i>] Yes, sir; they were the free papers of the
girl Zoe; but they were in my husband's secretary. How came they in
your possession?</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> I&mdash;I found them.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> And you purloined them?</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Hold on, you'll see. Go on, Colonel.</p>

<p>[<i>Together.</i>] <i>Mrs. Pey.</i> Zoe!</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Me!</p>

<p><i>Point.</i> At the time the judge executed those free papers to his infant
slave, a judgment stood recorded against him; while that was on
record he had no right to make away with his property. That judgment
still exists; under it and others this estate is sold to-day. Those
free papers ain't worth the sand that's on 'em.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pey.</i> Zoe a slave! It is impossible!</p>

<p><i>Point.</i> It is certain, madam; the judge was negligent, and doubtless
forgot this small formality.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> But the creditors will not claim the gal?</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Excuse me; one of the principal mortgagees has made the
demand.</p>

trembling so, you'll fall down directly. This blow has staggered me
some.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. Pey.</i> O, Zoe, my child! don't think too hardly of your poor
father.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> I shall do so if you weep. See, I'm calm.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Calm as a tombstone, and with about as much life. I see it in
your face.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> It cannot be! It shall not be!</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Hold your tongue&mdash;it must. Be calm&mdash;darn the things; the
proceeds of this sale won't cover the debts of the estate. Consarn
those Liverpool English fellers, why couldn't they send something by
the last mail? Even a letter, promising something&mdash;such is the
feeling round amongst the planters. Darn me, if I couldn't raise
thirty thousand on the envelope alone, and ten thousand more on the
post-mark.</p>

<p><i>George.</i> Zoe, they shall not take you from us while I live.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Don't be a fool; they'd kill you, and then take her, just as
soon as&mdash;stop; Old Sunnyside, he'll buy her! that'll save her.</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> No, it won't; we have confessed to Dora that we love each other.
How can she then ask her father to free me?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> What in thunder made you do that?</p>

<p><i>Zoe.</i> Because it was the truth; and I had rather be a slave with a
free soul, than remain free with a slavish, deceitful heart. My
father gives me freedom&mdash;at least he thought so. May Heaven bless him
for the thought, bless him for the happiness he spread around my
life. You say the proceeds of the sale will not cover his debts. Let
me be sold then, that I may free his name. I give him back the
liberty he bestowed upon me; for I can never repay him the love he
bore his poor Octoroon child, on whose breast his last sigh was
drawn, into whose eyes he looked with the last gaze of affection.</P>

<p><i>Mrs. Pey.</i> O, my husband! I thank Heaven you have not lived to see

<p><i>Point.</i> Now, gentlemen, we shall proceed to business. It ain't
necessary for me to dilate, describe, or enumerate; Terrebonne is
known to you as one of the richest bits of sile in Louisiana, and its
condition reflects credit on them as had to keep it. I'll trouble you
for that piece of baccy, Judge&mdash;thank you&mdash;so, gentlemen, as life is
short, we'll start right off. The first lot on here is the estate in
block, with its sugar-houses, stock, machines, implements, good
dwelling-houses and furniture. If there is no bid for the estate and
stuff, we'll sell it in smaller lots. Come, Mr. Thibodeaux, a man has

yourself. And, strangers, ain't we forgetting there's a lady present.
[<i>The knives disappear.</i>] If we can't behave like Christians, let's try
and act like gentlemen. Go on, Colonel.</p>

<p><i>Lafouche.</i> He didn't ought to bid against a lady.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> O, that's it, is it? Then I'd like to hire a lady to go to
auction and buy my hands.</p>

<p><i>Point.</i> Gentlemen, I believe none of us have two feelings about the
conduct of that man; but he has the law on his side&mdash;we may regret,
but we must respect it. Mr. M'Closky has bid twenty-five thousand
dollars for the Octoroon. Is there any other bid? For the first time,

<p><i>Ratts.</i> Yes; you was the first to hail Judge Lynch.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> [R.] Well, what's the use of argument whar guilt sticks out
so plain; the boy and Injiun were alone when last seen.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> (L. C.) Who says that?</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Everybody&mdash;that is, I heard so.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Say what you know&mdash;not what you heard.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> I know then that the boy was killed with that tomahawk&mdash;the
red-skin owns it&mdash;the signs of violence are all round the shed&mdash;this

boy, and when sober concealed the body yonder?</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> That's it&mdash;that's it.</p>

<p><i>Ratts.</i> Who defends the Injiun?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> I will; for it is agin my natur' to b'lieve him guilty; and if
he be, this ain't the place, nor you the authority to try him. How
are we sure the boy is dead at all? There are no witnesses but a rum
bottle and an old machine. Is it on such evidence you'd hang a human
being?</p>

<p><i>Ratts.</i> His own confession.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> I appeal against your usurped authority. This lynch law is a
wild and lawless proceeding. Here's a pictur' for a civilized
community to afford; yonder, a poor, ignorant savage, and round him
a circle of hearts, white with revenge and hate, thirsting for his
blood; you call yourselves judges&mdash;you ain't&mdash;you're a jury of
executioners. It is such scenes as these that bring disgrace upon our
Western life.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Evidence! Evidence! Give us evidence. We've had talk enough;
now for proof.</p>

O, laws-a-mussey, see dis; here's a pictur' I found stickin' in that

<p><i>Scud.</i> A photographic plate. [<i>Pete holds lantern up.</i>] What's this, eh?
two forms! The child&mdash;'tis he! dead&mdash;and above him&mdash;Ah! ah! Jacob
M'Closky, 'twas you murdered that boy!</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Me?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> You! You slew him with that tomahawk; and as you stood over his
body with the letter in your hand, you thought that no witness saw
the deed, that no eye was on you&mdash;but there was, Jacob M'Closky,
there was. The eye of the Eternal was on you&mdash;the blessed sun in
heaven, that, looking down, struck upon this plate the image of the
deed. Here you are, in the very attitude of your crime!</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> 'Tis false!</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> 'Tis true! the apparatus can't lie. Look there, jurymen.
[<i>Shows plate to jury.</i>] Look there. O, you wanted evidence&mdash;you called
for proof&mdash;Heaven has answered and convicted you.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> What court of law would receive such evidence? [<i>Going.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Ratts.</i> Stop; this would. You called it yourself; you wanted to make
us murder that Injiun; and since we've got our hands in for justice,
we'll try it on you. What say ye? shall we have one law for the
red-skin and another for the white?</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> Try him! Try him!</p>

<p><i>Ratts.</i> Who'll be accuser?</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> I will! Fellow-citizens, you are convened and assembled here

abroad on the ocean, when the army is before the enemy where in
thunder's the law? It is in the hearts of brave men, who can tell
right from wrong, and from whom justice can't be bought. So it is
here, in the wilds of the West, where our hatred of crime is measured
by the speed of our executions&mdash;where necessity is law! I say, then,
air you honest men? air you true? Put your hands on your naked
breasts, and let every man as don't feel a real American heart there,
bustin' up with freedom, truth, and right, let that man step
out&mdash;that's the oath I put to ye&mdash;and then say, Darn ye, go it!</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> Go on. Go on.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> Stop! Search him, we may find more evidence.</p>

<p><i>M'Closky.</i> Would you rob me first, and murder me afterwards?</p>

<p><i>Ratts.</i> [<i>Searching him.</i>] That's his programme&mdash;here's a pocket-book.</p>

<p><i>Scud.</i> [<i>Opens it.</i>] What's here? Letters! Hello! To "Mrs. Peyton,
Terrebonne, Louisiana, United States." Liverpool post mark. Ho! I've
got hold of the tail of a rat&mdash;come out. [<i>Reads.</i>] What's this? A
draft for eighty-five thousand dollars, and credit on Palisse and Co.,
of New Orleans, for the balance. Hi! the rat's out. You killed the boy
to steal this letter from the mail-bags&mdash;you stole this letter, that
the money should not arrive in time to save the Octoroon; had it done
so, the lien on the estate would have ceased, and Zoe be free.</p>

<p><i>Omnes.</i> Lynch him! Lynch him! Down with him!</p>
